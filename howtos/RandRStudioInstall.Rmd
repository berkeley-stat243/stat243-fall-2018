If your version of R is older than 3.4.0, please install the latest version, though you may be fine with older versions.

To install R, see:

  * MacOS: install the R-3.5.1.pkg from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/ if you have OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher (or the R-3.3.3.pkg package if you have OS X 10.9 or 10.10)
  * Windows: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
  * Linux: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/

Then install RStudio. To do so, see https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop.

Verify that you can install add-on R packages by installing the 'fields' package. In RStudio, go to 'Tools->Install Packages'. In the resulting dialog box, enter 'fields' (without quotes) in the 'Packages' field. Depending on the location specified in the 'Install to Library' field, you may need to enter your administrator password. To be able to install packages to the directory of an individual user, you may need to do the following:

  * In R, enter the command `Sys.getenv()['R_LIBS_USER']`.
  * Create the directory specified in the result that R returns, e.g., on a Mac, this might be `~/Library/R/3.5/library`.

For more detailed installation instructions for Windows, see the windowsInstall.html file.
