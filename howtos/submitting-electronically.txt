You will need to create a private repository on GitHub for submitting your
problem sets (in addition to submitting a paper copy).

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, you will need to create one:
https://github.com/join

You can choose a silly name, but I **recommend** choosing something
straightforward and informative. For instance, my GitHub username is
`paciorek`. You should register using your `@berkeley.edu` account (you will
need to have a verified *.edu email address for step 2).

2. Once you have a GitHub account you will need to request an educational
discount so that you can create private repos for this class. If you don't have
private accounts already (if you don't know if you do or not, you don't),
please request one here: https://education.github.com/

You are a `Student` and you want an `Individual account`.

Once you have a GitHub account and the ability to create private GitHub
repos, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Create a private repository on GitHub called `stat243` (without the quotes).
You will need to use this exact name (no space, no capital letters, etc.).
Select `Initialize this repository with a README` and choose `R` in the
pull-down menu to add a `.gitignore` file.

2. Add Chris (use his GitHub name: paciorek) and Omid (use his GitHub name:
osolari) as collaborators so we can push and pull to your private GitHub
repo. In the lower right-hand corner of your repository's main page, you should
see a button labelled `Settings`. Click on the `Settings` button will take you
to a page where you can edit various settings for your repository. Choose the
`Collaborators` button on the `Settings` page.

3. Clone the repo to your home directory (I would clone it into a directory
just for repositories (e.g., I use `~/repos`). In the top-level of your working
directory, create a file named (exactly) `info.json` without the quotes. In this
file, you need to set the following variables:
-------------------------
{
	"name": "Sarah Zhang",
	"SID": "012345234",
	"email": "foo@berkeley.edu",
	"github_name": "doctordo",
	"status": "enrolled"
}
-------------------------

The variable names (name, SID, email, github_name) have to be exactly as specified above.
i.e. Only change the items in the quotation marks.  
An example `info.json` file can be found in this directory.
Your status should be one of `"enrolled"`, `"waitlist"`, or `"audit"`.
When you're finished, add, commit, push, and then fill out this google form:
https://goo.gl/forms/XXXX [under construction]

If you need additional details, here are more detailed directions that Jarrod
Millman provided to undergraduates for a different class.

If you use the above link, make sure you don't just type in what it says to do
as you will need to modify the instructions to apply to this class. For
instance, use `stat243` not `stat133`, make sure to add Chris and Omid as
collaborators (and not Karl or Inga), and verify that the info file is in json format as above.

Repository Organization
The problem sets in your repository should be organized into folders with specific filenames.  
When we pull from your repository, our code will be assuming the following structure:

your_repo/
├── ps1/
│   ├── ps1.pdf
│   ├── ps1.rnw (.rmd, .lyx, .tex, .r)
├── ps2/
│   ├── ...
├── ...
├── ps8/
└── info.json

The file names are case-sensitive, so please keep everything lowercase.
